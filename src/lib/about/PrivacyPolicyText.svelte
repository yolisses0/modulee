		technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
		address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
		to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose
		to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

<h2 id="what-legal-bases-do-we-rely-on-to-process-your-information">
	3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
</h2>
<p>
	In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a
	valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to
	comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
	obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
</p>
<p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
<p>
	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal
	bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the
	following legal bases to process your personal information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use
		your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
		Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary
		to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests
		and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for
		some of the purposes described in order to:
	</li>
	<li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
	<li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
	<li>
		Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
		compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
		regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence
		in litigation in which we are involved.
	</li>
	<li>
		Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect
		your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
		potential threats to the safety of any person.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
<p>
	We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent)
	to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission
	can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
</p>
<p>
	In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
	information without your consent, including, for example:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
		timely way
	</li>
	<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	<li>
		If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or
		settle an insurance claim
	</li>
	<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
	<li>
		If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
		financial abuse
	</li>
	<li>
		If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability
		or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to
		investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
	</li>
	<li>
		If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
		relating to the production of records
	</li>
	<li>
		If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession
		and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
	</li>
	<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
	<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
	<li>
		We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject
		to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments
	</li>

<h2 id="do-we-use-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies">
	5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
</h2>
<p>
	In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
	information.
</p>
<p>
	We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather
	information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us
	maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
	preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
</p>
<p>
	We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our
	Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to
	tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending
	on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology
	to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear
	either on our Services or on other websites.
</p>
<p>
	To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a “sale”/“sharing” (which
	includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state
	laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described
	below under section “DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?”
</p>
<p>
	Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
	set out in our Cookie Notice:
	<a href="https://modulee.app/cookie-policy">https://modulee.app/cookie-policy</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
	We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of the Services.
	To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit
	<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

<h2 id="how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
<p>
	In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may
	have access to certain information about you.
</p>
<p>
	Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media
	account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
	certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we
	receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
	name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
	make public on such a social media platform.
</p>
<p>
	We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy
	Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do
	not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
	third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand
	how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy
	preferences on their sites and apps.
</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>
	In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
	this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p>
	We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
	out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such
	as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us
	keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an
	account with us.
</p>
<p>
	When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
	either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
	your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
	personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p>
	In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
	technical security measures.
</p>
<p>
	We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures
	designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
	safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
	information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
	guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
	defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
	will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
	from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
	environment.
</p>
<h2 id="do-we-collect-information-from-minors">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
<p>
	In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the
	equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
	We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the
	equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
	information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age
	as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
	and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
	from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your
	jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to
	promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected
	from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please
	contact us at moduleeapp@gmail.com.
</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-privacy-rights">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p>
	In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European
	Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you
	greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate
	your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
</p>
<p>
	In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under
	applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a
	copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
	processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to
	be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly
	significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main
	factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also
	have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a
	request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
	US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.
</p>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>
	If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
	information, you also have the right to complain to your
	<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"
		>Member State data protection authority</a
	>
	or

	If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the
	<a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html"
		>Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a

</p>
<p>
	Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
	which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
	withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
	using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?”
	below.
</p>
<p>
	However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
	withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
	information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
</p>
<h3 id="account-information">Account Information</h3>
<p>
	If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate
	your account, you can:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
	<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and

	prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms
	and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
	Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
	prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you
	choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
	Services. For further information, please see our Cookie Notice:

<p>
	If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
	moduleeapp@gmail.com.
</p>
<h2 id="controls-for-do-not-track-features">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>
	Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
	(“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
	about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
	technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
	do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
	communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
	that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
	this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
	California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because
	there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we
	do not respond to them at this time.
